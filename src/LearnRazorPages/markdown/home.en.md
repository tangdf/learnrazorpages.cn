# Welcome

This site is dedicated to helping developers who want to use the ASP.NET Core Razor Pages web development framework.

## What Is Razor Pages?

ASP.NET Core Razor Pages is a page controller framework for building dynamic, data-driven web sites with clean separation of concerns. Based on the latest version of ASP.NET from Microsoft - [ASP.NET Core](/asp-net-core), Razor Pages supports cross platform development and can be deployed to Windows, Unix and Mac operating systems.

The Razor Pages framework is lightweight and very flexible. It provides the developer with full control over rendered HTML. The framework is built on top of ASP.NET Core MVC, and is enabled by default when MVC is enabled in a .NET Core application. Razor Pages is the recommended framework for cross platform server-side HTML generation on .NET Core. You do not need to have any knowledge or understanding of MVC to work with Razor Pages.

Razor Pages makes use of the popular C#  programming language for server-side programming, and the easy-to-learn [Razor templating syntax](https://www.mikesdotnetting.com/article/153/inline-razor-syntax-overview) for embedding C# in HTML markup to generate content for browsers dynamically.

## Who should use Razor Pages?

Razor Pages is suitable for all kinds of developers from beginners to enterprise level. It is based on a page-centric development model, offering a familiarity to web developers with experience of other page-centric frameworks such as PHP, Classic ASP, Java Server Pages, ASP.NET Web Pages and ASP.NET Web Forms. It is also relatively easy for the beginner to learn, and it includes all of the advanced features of ASP.NET Core making it just as suitable for large, scalable, team-based projects.

## How to get Razor Pages

Razor Pages is included as part of .NET Core 2.0, which is [available as a free download](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core) as either an SDK (Software Development Kit) or a Runtime. The SDK includes the runtime and command line tools for creating .NET Core applications. The SDK is installed for you when you install Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 or later. The runtime is used to run .NET Core applications. The Runtime-only installation is intended for use on machines where no development takes place.

## Why should you use Razor Pages?

If you want a dynamic web site, that is one where the content is regularly being added to, you have a number of options available to you. You can use a Content Management System (CMS), of which there are many to choose from including WordPress, Joomla!, Drupal, Orchard CMS and so on. Or you can hire someone to build a suitable site for you. Or you can build your own if you have an interest in, and an aptitude for programming.

If you choose to build your own, you can choose from a wide range of programming languages and frameworks. If you are a beginner, you will probably want to start with a framework and language that is easy to learn, well supported and robust. If you are considering making a career as a programmer, you probably want to know that the skills you acquire while learning your new framework will enhance your value to potential employers. In both cases, learning C# as a language and ASP.NET Core as a framework will tick those boxes. If you are a seasoned developer, the Razor Pages framework is likely to add to your skillset with the minimum amount of effort.
